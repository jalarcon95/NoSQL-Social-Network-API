  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  The purpose of this project was to create a functional API for a social network app using a NoSQL database such as MongoDB to handle large amounts of unstructured data. The API allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Expressjs is used to for routing and Mongoose allows the models to be synced to MongoDB. JavaScript native 'dateFormat' object is used to create timestamps. This is not a deployed app, therefore a video walkthough was added to demonstrate API functionality.
